# Process Mining
This repository contains introductory information in the field of process mining. Process mining helps in the analysis of business processes based on event logs. 

# Softwares
1. ProM: Installation instructions followed from [this link](http://www.promtools.org/doku.php?id=gettingstarted:installation) installs both ProM 6.x and Package Manager
2. Disco 

# Observations
	1. Process models are constructed from event logs obtained from a system - for example online peer review system
	2. Models are built using discovery mining that includes alpha, heuristic, fuzzy and social network techniques / algorithms
	3. Deviations are monitored by comparing the models with observed events using conformance check technique
	4. Conformance mining includes LTL checker, performance analysis with petri nets etc
	5. Third step is to detect bottlenecks and deviations 
	6. ProM and disco are two open source frameworks that can be used 
	7. These frameworks accept data in XES and MXML formats
